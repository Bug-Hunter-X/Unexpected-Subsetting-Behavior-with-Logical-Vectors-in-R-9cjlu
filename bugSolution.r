# Safer subsetting function that checks lengths and throws an error if they don't match.

safer_subset <- function(df, logical_vector) {
  if (length(logical_vector) != nrow(df)) {
    stop("Length of logical vector does not match the number of rows in the data frame.")

}

df <- data.frame(a = 1:5, b = letters[1:5])

# Attempting to subset with the safer function will throw an error:
# safer_subset(df, logical_vector)

# Correct usage:
correct_logical_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
result <- safer_subset(df, correct_logical_vector)
print(result)
